Reporty-ng
==========
**Reporty-ng** (former TestNG-XSLT) offers user-friendly [TestNG](http://testng.org/doc/index.html) reports while taking full advantage of the features in the TestNG-specific XML output (`testng-results.xml`). Pure XSL is used to generate the output and no images or other external files are used. The project uses XSL 2.0 and Saxon as a transformer.

The current version is 1.2 and the changelog is available here: https://github.com/cosminaru/reporty-ng/wiki/Changelog
