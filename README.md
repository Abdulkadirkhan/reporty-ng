reporty-ng
==========
**reporty-ng** offers user-friendly [TestNG](http://testng.org/doc/index.html) reports while taking full advantage of the features in the TestNG-specific XML output (`testng-results.xml`). Pure XSL is used to generate the output and no images or other external files are used. The project uses XSL 2.0 and Saxon as a transformer.
